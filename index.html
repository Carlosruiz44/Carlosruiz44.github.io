We typically start with looking at the best opportunities first; analyzing the three aspects of Supply Management, Demand Management, and Energy Control Measures Installation, also tracking your progress by analyzing your meter data to see how well your energy-saving efforts have worked.</p>

                        <p>RPA Energy is an EGS (Electric Generation Supplier) licenses by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission with license number A-2012-2325273. RPA Energy provides reliable energy to our customers at an extremely fair rate.</p>

                        <p>Electricity deregulation has changed how Pennsylvania residents shop for their energy needs. Our customers now have a choice and therefore greater control over their electric bill. Consumers can leave their generation supplier for a better rate with an alternate supplier. When you choose a new electric supplier, you are choosing the company that generates your electricity. Generation supply costs make up the majority of the average electric bill, so you may be able to find significant savings. Remember, regardless of who generates your electricity, your electric utility will continue to be your point of contact for all outages, emergency services and questions about your residential service.</p>

                        <p>RPA Energy's mission is to provide energy to our customers at a reasonable low price. Our executive team and experienced energy managers are committed to embracing electric deregulation and determining ways to create value for our customers. Cutting edge pricing, custom products and thoughtful billing and customer service are the primary strengths that separate RPA Energy from its competition in the market.</p>

                        <p>You need electricity and we buy it for you from the power plants and wind farms that are located right here in your neighborhood. Your power generation source, poles, lines, maintenance and repair all stay the same. The small difference is that you'll get the best available rate for your electricity, excellent customer service, and a straightforward bill which you can review in your account area whenever you wish.</p>

                        <p>Switching to RPA Energy just takes a couple of minutes. All we need is some basic information about you and your service address and we take care of the rest. It's that easy to start saving today!</p>

                <p>
                    <h4>Enviormental Benefits</h4>
                </p>

                <p>Minimal, if any, byproducts of CO2 and other pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead in comparison to those produced in the creation of energy through fossil fuels.</p>

                <p>
                    <h4>Stimulating Our Economy</h4>
                </p>

                <p>Renewable energy resources are developed here in New York State. Furthering their development will keep millions of dollars here, creating more jobs.</p>

                <p>
                    <h4>Our Future</h4>
                </p>

                <p>
                This will depend on the technological advancements of renewable energy sources. We will always have water, wind and the sun.
